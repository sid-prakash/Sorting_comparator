# Sorting_comparator

Compares the runtime of 4 different sorting algorithms: Selection sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort and Quick sort.

Given random integers of inputed size or a text file (/src/PointTest.txt) with integers, the program will sort them using the various sorting algrothims and display the runtimes of each sorting algrothim in nanoseconds.
